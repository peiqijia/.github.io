            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h6> Hi! My name is Peiqi.</h6>
        <p>I am a Chinese girl who studies in graphic design major, currently attending the University of Massachuesetts Dartmouth.
        For most of my life, I have lived in my hometown Zhengzhou, China. I started to learn drawing since four years old. Then my life connected with art.
        <br> When I grow up, I started to write Chinese Calligraphy, it is another kind of art which can make me concentrate on my work. Later, I decided come to
        American to study the graphic design, because I want to learn more skills about design. Also, I like creating differnt kind of interesting stuff.
        Today, I am a designer, Calligrapher, and Photographer. 
        <br> In my free time, I enjoy writing Chinese Calligraphy,shooting some beautiful photos, listening to music, 
        hand drawing the things I like, and going on as many adventures as I can with friends and family.
